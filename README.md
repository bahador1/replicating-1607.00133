# replicating-1607.00133
Replication of differentially private MNIST Classification from [arxiv:1607.00133](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.00133) in pytorch.

## Todolist wednesday
- [X] Which plots?
  - 1.1 - 1.3 -> accuracy for different levels of noise (fig. 3)
  - 2 -> accuracy for epsilon, deltas (fig. 4)
  - 3 -> influence of epsilon on pca 
- [ ] Fix up github repo
